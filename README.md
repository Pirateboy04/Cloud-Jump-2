Cloud Jump 2
================

Expanding on the original [Cloud Jump][1] created by [BashedCrab][2]. Special thanks to [cclauss][3], [jsbain][4], and [SebastianJarsve] [5] for their contributions. 

Additional completed features so far:
------
* Sound Effects (when bouncing on a cloud, when dying, and when getting a new high score)
* Play in Portrait or Landscape Mode
* Player's High Score is saved
	* Player's name is also saved, and only needs to be entered by the player once.
* Monsters! 
* Program now uses sprites instead of images
	* Sprites greatly simplify updating and drawing code by moving to scene.Layers.

See the [repo's issue page][6] to find out what is currently being worked on and what will be implemented next.

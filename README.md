Cloud Jump 2
================

Expanding on [BashedCrab][1]'s original [Cloud Jump][2].

Special thanks to [cclauss][3], [jsbain][4], and [SebastianJarsve] [5] for their contributions. 

Additional completed features so far:
------
* Sound Effects played in Threads when the Player:
        * bounces off a cloud
        * is killed
        * gets a new high score
* Play in Portrait or Landscape Mode
* Player's High Score is saved
	* Player's name is also saved, and only needs to be entered by the player once.
* Monsters!  If you are careful, you can use the same cloud as a monster but don't land on one!!
* Program now uses sprites instead of images
	* Sprites greatly simplify updating and drawing code by moving to scene.Layers.

See the [repo's issue page][6] to find out what is currently being worked on and what will be implemented next.
